## SLIDE 2: The Problem (Make it Personal)
**[Visual: Split screen - Left: Frustrated customer on phone. Right: Different cleaners at door each week]**

### **Every cleaning service treats your home like it's their first time**

**The $100B cleaning industry is broken:**

🔄 **Different cleaner every time** - Start from zero each visit
❌ **No memory** - Explain preferences repeatedly  
😤 **Inconsistent quality** - 60% quit due to inconsistency
📱 **Stone-age tech** - Phone calls and paper schedules

**[Big stat in center]**
### **In affluent North Dallas: ZERO tech-enabled cleaning services**
*842,000 residents. $142K median income. Not one AI-powered option.*
