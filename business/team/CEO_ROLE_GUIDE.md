# üéØ CEO Guide for Tim Nguyen
## How to Be the CEO of Maidly.ai

*A simple guide to leading our AI-powered cleaning startup*

---

## üëã **Welcome to Being a CEO**

Hey Tim! You're now the CEO of Maidly.ai. This might feel overwhelming, but don't worry - being a CEO is really just being a manager, but for the whole company instead of one department.

### **What Does CEO Actually Mean?**
- **C**hief **E**xecutive **O**fficer = The person who makes sure everything gets done
- You're the "quarterback" - you don't do everything, but you make sure everyone knows what to do
- Think of it like being a restaurant manager, but instead of one restaurant, you're managing the whole business

### **Our Team Structure (Keep It Simple)**
- **Harrison**: Chairman (your boss's boss - gives big picture guidance)
- **You (Tim)**: CEO (the day-to-day leader who makes things happen)
- **Ian**: Tech guy (helps with the app and AI stuff)

### **Your Main Job**
Get us from 0 customers to 200+ customers in 6 months. That's it. Everything else supports this goal.

## üéØ **What You Actually Do Every Day**

Think of being CEO like being a project manager for 4 big projects at once:

### **Project 1: Get Money ($100K Fundraising)**
**What this means**: We need $100K to start the business
**Your job**: 
- Meet with people who might invest
- Show them our business plan (we already wrote this for you)
- Convince them to give us money
- **Like**: Asking your parents for money to start a lemonade stand, but more professional

### **Project 2: Build the Team**
**What this means**: We can't do everything ourselves
**Your job**:
- Find a "Chief Maid" (the person who manages all our cleaners)
- Find 4 smart people to help run different parts of the business
- Make sure everyone knows what they're supposed to do
- **Like**: Being a team captain and picking your players

### **Project 3: Get Customers**
**What this means**: Find people who want to pay us to clean their houses
**Your job**:
- Make sure our ads are working (Facebook, Nextdoor)
- Make sure customers are happy with our service
- Start in Frisco, then expand to other areas
- **Like**: Running a successful restaurant - get customers, keep them happy, expand

### **Project 4: Manage Money**
**What this means**: Don't run out of cash before we're making profit
**Your job**:
- Watch how much we're spending
- Make sure we're charging the right prices
- Keep track of how much money we're making
- **Like**: Managing a household budget, but for a business

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **What Could Go Wrong (And How to Avoid It)**

### **The Big Risks**
1. **Bad Hires**: If our Chief Maid or key people suck, we fail
   - **How to avoid**: Interview carefully, check references, start with trial periods

2. **Unhappy Customers**: Rich people talk - one bad review spreads fast
   - **How to avoid**: Always fix problems immediately, over-communicate

3. **Running Out of Money**: If we don't hit our goals, no more funding
   - **How to avoid**: Watch spending like a hawk, hit customer targets

4. **Competition**: Big companies could copy our AI idea
   - **How to avoid**: Move fast, build loyal customers, keep improving

### **What You Control vs. What You Don't**
**You Control:**
- Who we hire
- How we treat customers  
- How we spend money
- How hard we work

**You Don't Control:**
- What competitors do
- Economic downturns
- Seasonal changes
- Random bad luck

**Focus on what you control.**

## ü§î **When to Make Decisions Yourself vs. Ask for Help**

### **Just Do It (Don't Ask Permission)**
- Hiring cleaners, customer service people
- Spending money on ads (within budget)

- Day-to-day operations

### **Ask Harrison First**
- Spending more than $10,000 at once
- Changing our strategy
- Hiring the 4 key people (operations, marketing, tech, finance)
- Expanding to new cities

### **Need Everyone to Agree**
- Raising more money

## üéØ **Remember: You're Building Something Big**

This isn't just a cleaning business. You're creating the future of home services.

**In 5 years, when someone says "I need my house cleaned," they should think "Maidly.ai" the same way they think "Uber" for rides.**

Every decision you make should ask: "Does this help us become the national leader?"
