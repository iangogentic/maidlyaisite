## The Opportunity

The $100B U.S. cleaning industry remains remarkably fragmented and technologically stagnant. Despite massive demand for reliable, personalized home services, no company has successfully built a modern, scalable brand that leverages technology to deliver superior customer experiences.

**Maidly.ai is building the first AI-powered cleaning service brand** - transforming a traditional industry through intelligent personalization, creating a category-defining company that will become the "Starbucks of home cleaning."
