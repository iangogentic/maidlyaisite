# Introducing Maidly.ai: The Future of Home Cleaning

Today, we're excited to announce Maidly.ai—a revolutionary approach to home cleaning that combines professional service with artificial intelligence to create a truly personalized experience.

## The Problem We're Solving

Traditional cleaning services face a fundamental challenge: they treat every home the same. Your cleaner might use products you're allergic to, miss areas that matter to you, or forget special instructions about your pets. Each visit feels like starting over.

We believe your home deserves better.

## Our Solution: AI-Powered Memory

Maidly.ai introduces an AI assistant that learns and remembers your preferences. Here's how it works:

### 1. Learning Phase
During your first few cleanings, our AI pays attention to your feedback:
- "Please use unscented products—I have allergies"
- "My cat is friendly, no need to contain him"
- "The antique dresser needs extra gentle care"

### 2. Memory Building
This feedback gets processed and stored as structured preferences in our AI memory system. We use advanced natural language processing to understand context and intent.

### 3. Crew Briefings
Before each visit, our AI generates a personalized briefing for your cleaning crew, ensuring they know exactly how you like things done.
